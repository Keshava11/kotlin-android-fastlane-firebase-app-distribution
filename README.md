Firebase App Distribution
-------------------------

:fire: **Firebase App Distribution** makes distributing your apps to trusted testers painless. By getting your apps onto testers' devices quickly, you can get feedback early and often. And, if you use Crashlytics in your apps, youâ€™ll automatically get stability metrics for all your builds, so you know when youâ€™re ready to ship. Please visit [Firebase App Distribution page](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution) fore more detail.

fastlane
--------

:rocket: **fastlane** is the easiest way to automate beta deployments and releases for your iOS and Android apps. ðŸš€ It handles all tedious tasks, like generating screenshots, dealing with code signing, and releasing your application. Please visit [fastlane page](https://docs.fastlane.tools/) fore more detail.

To-do list

Firebase side
-------------

In this part, we will learn how to register our app via [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/).

#### Create a Firebase project

Before you can add Firebase to your Android app, you need to create a Firebase project to connect to your Android app. [Visit Understand Firebase Projects](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more) to learn more about Firebase projects.

1. In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/), click **Add project**, then select or enter a **Project name**.

</p>

2. Click **Continue**.
3. Click **Create project**.

#### Register your app with Firebase

1. In the center of the [Firebase console's project overview page](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/), click the **Android** icon to launch the setup workflow.
2. Enter your app's [application ID](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id) in the **Android package name** field. An *application ID* is sometimes referred to as a **package name** (**e.g**: com.yourcompany.yourproject)
3. Enter other app information as prompted by the setup workflow. (SHA-1)
   * To get the debug certificate fingerprint, copy and paste below code block into your Terminal:
   `keytool -list -v \ -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore`
   * The default password for the debug keystore is android. The keytool then prints the fingerprint to the terminal. For example:
   `Certificate fingerprint: SHA1: DA:39:A3:EE:5E:6B:4B:0D:32:55:BF:EF:95:60:18:90:AF:D8:07:09`
4. Click **Register app**.

#### Add a Firebase configuration file

1. Add the Firebase Android configuration file to your app:
    * Click **Download google-services.json** to obtain your Firebase Android config file (google-services.json).
    * Move your config file into the module (app-level) directory of your app. **This is not required anymore, hereafter you can move all required info into strings resources. This is explained in the [Android side](#android-side)**
    
    ```
    dependencies {
    // Add the following line:
    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.2'  // Google Services plugin
    }
    ```
    * In your module (app-level) Gradle file (usually app/build.gradle), add a line to the bottom of the file.
    
    ```
    android {
    
    }

    // Add the following line to the bottom of the file:
    apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'  // Google Play services Gradle plugin
    ```
